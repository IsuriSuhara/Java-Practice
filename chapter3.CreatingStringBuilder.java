    /*Size is the number of characters currently in the sequence, and capacity is the number
    of characters the sequence can currently hold. Since a String is immutable, the size and
    capacity are the same. The number of characters appearing in the String is both the size
    and capacity.
    StringBuilder is constructed, it may start at the default capacity (which happens to be
    or one of the programmerâ€™s choosing. In the example, we request a capacity of 5. At
    this point, the size is 0 since no characters have been added yet, but we have space for 5.*/
